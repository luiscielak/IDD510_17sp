### 1. File Folder Structure

Having your project organized is key. Before you begin working on your project, setup your folder structure. This will allow you to keep a clear and organized mind throughout your project. 

- **_assets:** This folder contains fonts, icons, images, logos. These are to be shared with internal/external teams and it includes everything needed to build the app/site.

- **_exports:** This folder has all your design exports such as JPG, PNG, SVG files. Any time you export your design, they go here.

- **build:** This folder contains your source code along with any other code examples, references or modules.

- **design:** This folder contains all design files from Sketch, PhotoShop or Illustrator. These should be organized by purpose (wireframes, journeys, branding, etc).

- **docs:** This folder contains all your design documentation (Word, Pages) and presentation files (Keynote, PowerPoint).
